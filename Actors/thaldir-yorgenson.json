Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>@UUID[Compendium.adv-with-droop.class-feats.Item.7YVXzps9xWQfGIxt]{Ability Score Improvement}</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions.

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\n<p>The glyph is nearly @toggleEffect[Invisible] and requires a successful Intelligence (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation}) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.

am the middle brother of three \"Rockheads\" as my Ma would put it (Straldir and Baldir), born and raised in the great stronghold of Mithral Hall. My Da was one of the main smelters for our people. He was held in high esteem for his creation of \"Yorgenon Wootz\", which, if crafted correctly would hold an edge better than any other. It was also sturdy enough for the finest hammers. In my eyes he could've be a royal weapon smith to boot, but he always told me \"Boy, lets leave the crafting to those with the drive to impress\". He would take commissions now and again, and it was only later in life I realized he prioritized the common folk more than the higher casts. He lived by the motto \"Family First\" it was beaten into us as pups. Literally... I tried to take Baldir off guard, one slow afternoon, with a quick punt to the kneecaps and the next thing I knew I had Da's crucible cracking the side of my head Woke up three hours later to the old man leaning over me, all he said was \"Family first, you're lucky I hadn't stuck that in the fire yet\". And I never forgot it, incidentally helmets don't fit as snug on the right side of my head either... My brothers and I were as thick as thieves, always getting into to some sort of mischief. Provided we didn't break Gods laws or the Halls Ma would let us beat the tar out of each other with a shake of her head. I can still hear her mutter \"It's a wonder you three don't make the mountain fall down around us\". Straldir and I looked up to Baldir something fierce. He had a good 20 years on us. Even so, he always had time for us, showing us this thing and that thing, in hopes that we'd be \"Well rounded figures of society\". It was Ma and Pa's proudest moment when he was accepted to study as a Cleric of Clangeddin. His passing hit the family hard. It wasn't long into his studies that he went with other acolytes to help fend off an orcish incursion near Griffon's Nest. They had to build a makeshift raft due to high flood waters and it capsized. I'm sure you can imagine how well heavily armored dwarves fared in the high river waters. His drowned body was discovered days later, washed up a mile or so away from the great fork. Ma and Pa were drones going through life after that. It was all Straldir and I could do to make life bearable. I tried to understudy with my Da, but that did not go so well and all I got in return was some sore knuckles, thanks to Da's infamous tong whacking's and my initiate level Smithy Guild recognition. Bah, my heart and head just weren't in the Smelting/Smithing game. Da wasn't finding the love of the craft either and was ready for retirement. He sold the wootz recipie to our uncle Faldir and dedicated himself to \"The Quiet Life\", and took up small stone carving. He'd make games and figures for the local childeren to earn some \"Rocking Chair Money\" as he would put it. Straldir and I had a talk late one night on our next steps, we couldn't let the Yorgenson name fade. He was keen on joining the Clergy of Clangeddin like Baldir. I figured \"What the hell\" I wasn't doing anything productive in my life, and had no pathway to get there, so why not, at worst it could put some light back into Ma and Da;s life. By some random happenstance we were accepted. I hadn't seen Ma and Da so filled with joy since they laid the last stone on Baldir's mound. Life as an Acolyte started to grow on me. We were always followers of Clangeddin in the Yorgenson home,, but I found that my understanding of the runes came easily and doing his will was as natural as breathing. I did get reprimanded harshly at one point when they though me a deserter. It was another trip to Griffon's Nest, and they were about to ford the river. Suddenly a crippling fear washed over me and all I could see was Baldir's pale face looking up at me. I snuck around the back for the formation and made a break 5 miles away to a bridge that I could safely walk over (if it can hold a horse, it can hold a Thaldir). All was going well until the Giant invasion. Up til then I was back line, I would work in a healers tent and wield our Gods power at a distance. That's not to say I didn't get to revel in the sweet feeling of my hammer crunching through the occasional orc skull, it just was at the front of the line. I soon became head healer for a small platoon and with my knowledge of weapons and watching/learning from the others I found my element, I could dodge, strike, heal, and unleash Gods power, with an ease I never thought possible. and I LIKED it! I started to poke at the my other clergy brothers who stayed to the back of the fighting, all in jest, I told them \"C'mon, get in there, get yer hands dirty\". One or two followed me, but the rest remained safe in their healing tents. All was going well and I enjoyed my life to the fullest again. Then the Giant invasion hit the Hall's. In one day and night the Halls were ravaged. We were completely caught unaware. The military was scattered. We had to fight with all Clangeddin's might to stay alive and out of the way of the marauders. I had never seen anything like it, Huge beasts these were, came out of the sky and destroyed my home. By the end of it the Hall's were in ruin, most of the militia was obliterated, and we've had never seen so many dead. As it turns out, that was only the beginning. Sensing the opportunity, we became swarmed with a relentless stream of those buck toothed green excuses for life. Wave after wave of those bastards wanted to pick at the bones of what was left of my home. For the next 3 years it was around the clock, no rest, and when you were ordered to sleep you did it with your eyes open because you were too tired to close them. Always you had the constant drums, orcish drums of war are not my favorite sound but worse was trying to get two hours of shut-eye with all of the lights on. The bastards didn't see as well in the light, so it was mandatory we leave as many candles burning as possible. To this day I can't sleep soundly unless it's damn near blacked out. During one of the earlier incursions, our platoon was boxed in with no way of getting to a central rallying point. I lost Dobber and Strix that day. Good lads, I knew them when I was younger, not as well as I did now, and far less than they deserved. Dobber was on watch in one of the south junctions allowing us to get some much needed downtime. All was eerily quiet, that should've been the first clue something wasn't right. We were suddenly roused form our stooper by Dobber gurgling for help with an arrow sticking out of his throat. Next thing we knew they were on us. We lost over half the platoon that day, and I had the privilege of dragging them away from the swarm. With Dobber over my shoulder and dragging Strix's limp corpse by the arm, we got to an upper corridor that had recently been cleared, to our amazement and relief. A fresh set of arms were able to hold back two waves before things died down again. That was the night I distinctly remember something giving way in my mind. No Cleric, Priest or Acolyte, should call themselves a follower of Clangeddin and not be on the front lines with thier brothers and sisters of the faith. In true Yorgenson style, I barged into the high priests quarters and told him that myself. That imparting of wisdom cost me KP and double duty for a month, as well as garnished wages. Apparently the upper brass didn't see my taking the high priests bedchambers apart and donating it to the enlisted men as an act of charity. They were also quick to add through my protests, that embedding the back of a warhammer into the door was not a reminder to the High Priest that his people were dying and fighting for his comfort. As the fighting died down I was dragged into a tribunal and put on a probation. Which I might add was doubled when I delicately voiced my disgust that the high priest and the rest of the blasphemous upper brass weren't standing in front of me being judged. As a point of punctuation I may have smashed a warhammer down on a thousand year old podium adding its usefulness to encompass a rubble pile. Throughout my probation, not being able to leave the halls, I considered heavily leaving the clergy. It was during one of the darkest nights of my life, and perhaps the drunkest, I was awoken by a deafening retort and a blinding light. I was on my knees in an instant gripping my skull for all I could muster in shock and pain. In a disembodied voice I heard as loud as thunder \"What do you have to say for yourself, young Yorgenson?\". I said the first thing that came to mind, \"Clangeddins Balls man, turn down the light!\". The next moment I heard a brief chuckle and the world came back into focus. Looking up I could see the visage of the Father of Battle himself, Clangedinn but was unable to focus on him, it was like gazing through a warped looking glass of pure light. I suddenly realized what my first words to him were, but all be damned I said what I said and there's no taking that back. His words still reverberated through my soul, \"Get up, boy!\" your knees have no duty on this ground tonight\". I could feel his smile, his warmth in those words, it was not a rebuke. on my rising, he continued, \"Why do you wallow in a piteous ruin of your own making?\" As best I could I looked the visage of my God in the eyes \"My belief is strong but I can't abide by a gutless group of prats that spout your words and do the opposite with their actions.\" \"Let them tumble from their self made perches, I want no part of it\". I have never heard such a booming laugh in my existence. If you ever have a chance to make a god laugh, I highly recommend it, it'll give you the courage of a thousand men. \"My son, you are one of the few I can truly call \"Alaghor\" (true disciple of Clangeddin), you are on the path that I desire, stay the course, live your conviction\". \"Protect the unprotected, heal the meek and weak at heart\". \"Do this in my name and your journey will be as tempering a keen blade\". Noticing that my eyes were staring at the floor again, I looked up \"And the fat arsed bovine that sit in your high seats?\". Again with the chuckle, \"Yes, be patient, work with them, be the light for the pups to follow, work has already begun to that end\". \"Now go, you're about to be released from probation early\". With another crack of laughter, he was gone as quickly as he came in. The next few days were a blur. I indeed got a notice to appear in front of the tribunal, that morning. My probation was lifted with no expulsion from the clergy. I had never seen the tribunal judges so white in the face. Though I did have to swear that I wouldn't treat ancient artifacts as practice stones for my hammer. As for why I'm traveling out of my lovely Mithral Halls on a pilgrimage, you can thank Old Grizzly from the Rust Bucket pub for that. But that's a story for a different day...</p>","public":"<h1>Backstory</h1><p>I am the middle brother of three \"Rockheads\" as my Ma would put it (Straldir and Baldir), born and raised in the great stronghold of Mithral Hall. \n\nMy Da was one of the main smelters for our people.

I could feel his smile, his warmth in those words, it was not a rebuke. on my rising, he continued, \"Why do you wallow in a piteous ruin of your own making?\"  As best I could I looked the visage of my God in the eyes \"My belief is strong but I can't abide by a gutless group of prats that spout your words and do the opposite with their actions.\" \"Let them tumble from their self made perches, I want no part of it\". I have never heard such a booming laugh in my existence.  If you ever have a chance to make a god laugh, I highly recommend it, it'll give you the courage of a thousand men.  \"My son, you are one of the few I can truly call \"Alaghor\" (true disciple of Clangeddin), you are on the path that I desire, stay the course, live your conviction\". \"Protect the unprotected, heal the meek and weak at heart\". \"Do this in my name and your journey will be as tempering a keen blade\".  Noticing that my eyes were staring at the floor again, I looked up \"And the fat arsed bovine that sit in your high seats?\". Again with the chuckle, \"Yes,  be patient, work with them, be the light for the pups to follow, work has already begun to that end\". \"Now go, you're about to be released from probation early\".  With another crack of laughter, he was gone as quickly as he came in.\n\n\nThe next few days were a blur.  I indeed got a notice to appear in front of the tribunal, that morning.  My probation was lifted with no expulsion from the clergy.  I had never seen the tribunal judges so white in the face. Though I did have to swear that I wouldn't treat ancient artifacts as practice stones for my hammer.  \n\n\nAs for why I'm traveling out of my lovely Mithral Halls on a pilgrimage,  you can thank Old Grizzly from the Rust Bucket pub for that.  But that's a story for a different day... </p>"},"alignment":"Chaotic Good","race":"jAbA4vP6TMcn1Uf1","background":"Oja86wHhEOr1ke4E","originalClass":"yVPwUSZ0liMP7c5r","xp":{"value":0},"appearance":"Gender: Male\nEyes: Grey\nHeight: 4'8\"\nHair: Brown\nSkin: Fair as an Elven Ass\nAge: 148\nWeight: 280\n\nI would say my skin is Supple and fair, in truth, its war torn and scarred.","trait":"I have a crude sense of humor.\nI’m full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my military experience relevant to almost every combat situation.","ideal":"Independence.
