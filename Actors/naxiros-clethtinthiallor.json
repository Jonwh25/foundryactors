This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>@UUID[Compendium.adv-with-droop.class-feats.Item.SaNkLmvrfemeJtdR]{Ki}</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\n<p>You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\n<p>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\n<p>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Ki save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your &amp;Reference[wis]{Wisdom} modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Flurry of Blows <br /></strong> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\n<p><strong>Patient Defense<br /></strong> You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Step of the Wind<br /></strong> You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>@UUID[Compendium.adv-with-droop.class-feats.Item.M5dQ2eIhChwnrUzJ]{Unarmored Movement}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your &amp;Reference[dex]{Dexterity} modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>@UUID[Compendium.adv-with-droop.class-feats.Item.Z9mvtX4MihLjAHb6]{Ability Score Improvement}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
